# Dashboard
This Walmart Power BI data analysis project visualizes and summarizes key sales metrics from a multi-store dataset. 
Downloaded this dataset from Kaggle and cleaned it using Power Query, and made a report with the help of Power BI, and also used DAX.
The dashboard presents total sales of $6.74 billion, average weekly sales of $1.05 million, and tracks performance across 45 stores. 
Key insights include sales trends by date, store, and quarter, along with a comparison of holiday vs non-holiday sales.
Notably, holiday sales account for $505 million (7.5% of total sales), while Q3 generates the highest quarterly sales.
The interactive dashboard allows filtering by year, month, and store for deeper analysis, demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and business insight extraction from large-scale retail data
